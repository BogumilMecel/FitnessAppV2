# FitnessAppV2

## About

This is a project that I have started very long time ago and then realised I am not satisfied with how clean my code was, so I decided to start everything over.

Link to old project: https://github.com/Bodzio6978/FitnessApp

## What I plan to do

- Calories and nutrition module, in a form of a journal when user can add already existing products or add their own product
- Weight tracking module, which is responsible for showing weight progress of the user and storing weight entered by the user
- User body measurement module, which is responsible for showing users their progress and storing their measurements

## Technologies I want to use

- Kotlin
- Firebase
- Coroutines
- Dagger Hilt
- ROOM
- Jetpack Compose

## Installation

You can clone this project to your Android Studio and then generate .apk file but you won't have necessary files for the application to work properly. I may release this app to the google playstore soon.
